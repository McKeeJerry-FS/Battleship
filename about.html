           <p class="lead text-light">This game was built off using a tutorial learning the functionality with JavaScript. Once the game was created, I created a Homepage ofr the game and placed it into a web application style format using
               HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. The purpose of designing the web application is to demostrate first and foremost my ability to create a game using JavaScript including the ability to create functions and implement event handlers, as well 
               as demonstrate my knowledge of basic JavaScript fundamentals. The second purpose to designing the game this way is to demonstrate my ability to create a fully operational, multiple page web appliication
               with embedded JavaScript to run the game. The game is fully operational on both the Homepage and the game's main page.

                    <h3>The Code</h3><br>
                    <p>I started with writing out how I wanted the game to playout. Every needed action that needed to be done was diagramed. After writing everything out, I created all of the needed variables to start. Then I started thinking about the functions that I would need to play the game. A list was created that included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating the game board</li>
                        <li>Generating the ships and placing them on the board</li>
                        <li>Displaying things like Hits, Misses, and other important messages</li>
                        <li>Determining if a ship is sunk</li>
                        <li>Allowing a user to input their guess</li>
                        <li>Determining if the user's guess matches a ship's location</li>
                        <li>Determining if all ships have been sunk</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>From there I began to create the methods and functions that would be able to complete those functions. For example, I created a Fire function that handles what happenes after a user enters in the coordinates in the input box and clicks on the Fire Button. </p><br>
                    <p>Creating the game was a very new an exciting experience for me. Most of my coding experience has been in C#. This is the first large program that I have written in JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>The next step I took in creating the application was to place the game itself into a page whewre it can be accessed and played. I did this using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. After getting the application placed on a page, I moved toward creating a Homepage and this about page for the application.</p>
